- January 1999

0.50 Release
------------
 1) Added ODBC version of underlying Database API - optional at link time
 2) Added parameter binding 
 3) Corrected Bulk data retrieval. Bulk data now retrieved in its true
    binary format.
 4) Allow allow opening of multiple cursors
 5) Removed limit of 200 prepared statements in the lifetime of a
    perl script. Note: there is still a limit (in Dynamic SQL version)
    for the number of current prepared statements. If you prepare more
    than 128 statements you must destroy some of then using the undef
    command in perl.
 6) Chunk retrieval of binary/text data is  not yet implemented 
    (we have not been able to discover what the DBI implementation
    requires - Not yet documented by the DBI implementor)

0.51 Release
------------
 1) Correct fault in dbd_st_FETCH_attrib that prevented any calls being
    issued to the RDBMS system.
 2) Modified preparse function to allow for colon separator for database name

0.52 Release
------------
 1) Added call to dbd_st_finish to dbd_st_fetch to set the Active flag to
    off, and to close the cursor.
 2) Modified Empress.h and dbdimp.h to correct some minor problems with
    defined functions. Primarily to allow values for number of rows
    affected by SQL statements to be returned correctly.
